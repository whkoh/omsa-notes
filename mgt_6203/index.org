* Module 01: Linear Regression
** Steps in Regression Analysis
1. State problem
2. Use regression for:
   - Diagnostic, or
   - Predictive, or
   - Prescriptive analytics?
3. Select relevant response and explanatory variables
4. Collect data
   - Internal
   - External
   - Purchased
   - Experiment
5. Choose fitting method
   - Ordinary least squares (OLS)
   - Generalized least squares
   - Maximum likelihood
6. Fit model
7. Validate model with diagnostics
8. Refine and iterate from step 3
9. Use model
*** Business examples (Dependent vs independent variables)
- Used car price :: odometer reading, age of car, condition
- Sales :: ad spend
- Time taken to repair product :: experience of technician
- Product added to shopping card :: ratings/price
- Starting salary of new employee :: work and education experience
- Sale price of house :: square feet, bedrooms, location
- Customer default? :: Credit score, income, age
- Customer churn? :: Length of contract, age of customer
*** M1L1 quiz
1. Variable eg price *can* be either dependent or independent variable, depends on purpose of model
2. Binary value variable *can* be dependent variable, eg logistic regression
** Real estate pricing example
1. Example: sell house, predict listing price.
2. Can ask realtors, but is there a more analytical approach?
   - They normally use "comparables" to suggest a listing price
3. If actual data with price, size, bedroom and bathroom number, etc, are available, regression can be used to help get a better price estimate
*** Housing dataset `ecdat`
- Can be used for this problem
- Data from Canadian city Windsor from 1987
- Or, collect or scrape prices from the web
- Do EDA, e.g.:
  - histogram
  - correlation matrix
  - scatter plot with linear regression line
*** M1L2 quiz
1. For right-skewed distribution, mean is *larger* than median
2. Correlation coefficient only captures *linear* relationships
** Notation in regression analysis
- Explanatory :: independent variables
- Response :: dependent variables
- $i = 1, 2, ..., n$ :: $i$ th observation or record in dataset, typically a sample
- $x_{11},...,x_{p1}$, $x_{1n}, ..., x_{pn}$ :: $n$ observations of $p$ explanatory variables
- $y_1, ..., y_n$ ::  $n$ observations of the dependent variable
- $\bar{y}$ :: mean value of dependent variable, $y$
- $\bar{x}_k$ :: mean value of $x_k$ th explanatory variable
- $\beta_0, ..., \beta_p$ :: parameters of regression line for population
- $b_0, ..., b_p$ :: estimates of $\beta$ parameters obtained by fitting the *sample* data
- $\epsilon_i$ :: error term for $i$ th observation in population
- $e_i$ :: error term for $i$ th observation int he sample
- $\hat{y}_i$ :: estimated value of $y$ for the $i$ th observation in sample. Obtain by evaluating regression function at $x_i$
*** Steps with example
1. Observe data in `ecdat`, which is a sample
2. Build model for population (valid relation)
   $$
   Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i
   $$
3. $\epsilon_i$ are independently and identically distributed (iid) random variables, normally distributed with mean 0 and s.d. $\sigma$
4. We don't know $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, $\sigma$ so need to estimate with *sample* data
5. Using sample, we build model:
   $$
   Y_i = b_0 + b_1 X_i + e_i
   $$
