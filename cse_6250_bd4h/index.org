* Big Data Course Overview
** Introduction to Course Overview
   - Overview of big data analytics for healthcare.
   - Topics covered:
     - Healthcare applications of big data.
     - Algorithms used in applications.
     - Software systems for implementation.
   - Course structure alternates among these topics.

** Big Data Big Picture
   - Course focuses on three key areas:
     - Big data systems.
     - Scalable machine learning algorithms.
     - Healthcare applications.
   - Integration of these elements to solve healthcare problems.

** Healthcare Applications
   - Three types of healthcare applications:
     1. **Predictive Modeling**: Uses historical data to predict future outcomes.
     2. **Computational Phenotyping**: Converts electronic health records (EHRs) into meaningful clinical concepts.
     3. **Patient Similarity**: Identifies groups of patients with similar characteristics.
   - Starts with predictive modeling.

** Predictive Modeling Quiz Question
   - Predictive modeling example: predicting treatment effectiveness for epilepsy patients.
   - Quiz: Estimate percentage of patients responding to different treatments.

** Predictive Modeling Quiz Solution
   - Solution breakdown:
     - **Group A** (responded within 2 years): 32%.
     - **Group B** (responded between 2-5 years): 24%.
     - **Group C** (did not respond after 5 years): 44%.
   - Goal of predictive modeling:
     - Improve early response rates.
     - Identify non-responders for alternative treatments.

** Predictive Modeling Challenges
   - Challenges in predictive modeling:
     - Handling large patient datasets with various types of data.
     - Managing multiple models in a complex computational pipeline.
     - Evaluating and comparing multiple predictive pipelines.

** Computational Phenotyping
   - Converts raw patient data (e.g., demographics, diagnoses, medications, procedures, lab tests, clinical notes) into clinical concepts or phenotypes.

** Computational Phenotyping Quiz Question
   - Identifying data issues in phenotyping.
   - Quiz: List potential "waste products" in raw data.

** Computational Phenotyping Quiz Solution
   - Common data issues:
     - **Missing values**: Some important data may be absent.
     - **Duplicates**: Patient records may appear multiple times.
     - **Irrelevant data**: Not all raw information is useful.
     - **Redundant information**: Different records may indicate the same condition (e.g., diagnosis and medication for diabetes).

** Phenotyping Algorithm
   - Example: Identifying Type 2 Diabetes from EHR data.
   - Decision process:
     - Check for Type 1 Diabetes diagnosis.
     - Check for Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis.
     - Verify medication records and abnormal lab results.
   - Importance:
     - EHR data is often unreliable.
     - Multiple data sources improve diagnostic accuracy.

** Patient Similarity Quiz Question
   - Different types of reasoning doctors use:
     - Flowchart-based reasoning (like phenotyping algorithms).
     - Instinct and intuition.
     - Case-based reasoning (comparing patients to past cases).

** Patient Similarity Quiz Solution
   - Correct answer: **Case-based reasoning**.
   - Doctors often compare current patients to previous similar cases.

** Patient Similarity
   - Simulating case-based reasoning using algorithms.
   - Process:
     - Search for similar patients in a database.
     - Identify treatment outcomes for similar cases.
     - Recommend best treatment based on historical data.
   - Objective: Utilize full database knowledge instead of relying on a single doctor's experience.

** Algorithms
   - Introduction to machine learning algorithms in healthcare.
   - Covered topics:
     1. **Classification**: Mapping patient data to target variables (e.g., predicting heart attack risk).
     2. **Clustering**: Grouping similar patients based on health conditions.
     3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing large patient datasets to essential features.
     4. **Graph Analysis**: Analyzing relationships between patients and diseases.

** Systems
   - Introduction to big data systems for healthcare applications.
   - Covered systems:
     - **Hadoop**: Disk-based distributed system.
     - **Spark**: In-memory distributed system (faster than Hadoop).
   - Topics include:
     - Hadoop infrastructure (MapReduce, HDFS, Pig, Hive, HBase).
     - Spark infrastructure (Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, MLlib, GraphX).

* Predictive Modeling
* MapReduce
* Classification Model Metrics
** Predictive Model review
- Predictive model :: mapping function between model inputs and outputs (pred's)
- Model metrics :: needed to know how well they're performing
** Confusion matrix
- True positive/negative also known as "Condition" positive/negative
- Predicted positive/negative also known as "Prediction Outcome" positive/negative
** Accuracy metrics
All divided by ground truth values.
- Accuracy :: (TP+TN)/TP. Not most useful for imbalanced class
- True positive rate :: TP/CP (Sensitivity, Recall)
- False positive rate :: FP/CN
- False negative :: FN/CP
- True negative rate :: TN/CN (Specificity)
*** Other notes
- FP is a type I error.
- FN is a type II error.
- Hard to perform well on all metrics
- Important to choose the right metrics
** Predictive metrics
All divided by prediction outcomes.
- Prevalence :: CP/Total population. How likely disease occurs in population
- Positive predictive value (Precision) :: TP/Pred outcome positive.
- False discovery rate :: FP/Pred outcome positive
- Negative predictive value :: TN/Pred outcome negative
- False omission rate :: FN/Pred outcome negative
** F1 score
Harmonic mean of PPV and TPR
$$
F_1 = 2 \times \frac{PPV \times TPR}{PPV + TPR}
$$
** Classifier quiz
Which is the best classifier?
- Highest F1, PPV and Accuracy is the best classifier
** Reversing predictions
It's always possible to reverse the predictions so 0.21 might perform better than 0.69/0.50.
** Receiver operating characteristic
- Predictive models generally output continuous score.
- Threshold is needed as precision bound to force to a certain category
- ROC provides a way to compare performance of classifiers as the decision boundary is varied
- ROC curve is the plot of TP rate vs FP rate at various threshold values
  - We sort by prediction score (highest first)
  - Use prediction score as threshold values
  - Plot on the chart and see how many are misclassified (needs True value to be known)
- AUROC does not depend on the choice of threshold.
- AUROC is the most popular metric for classification
** "Best classifier threshold" quiz
- There isn't a standard answer, it depends on whether TP, TN or other metric is prioritized
** Regression metrics
- MAE :: average of absolute errors, harder to work with since the absolute value is not differentiable
- MSE :: average of squared errors, easier to work with as the derivative of squared term is linear. Increases a lot faster than MAE
- $R^2$ :: bounded by $(-\infty,1)$. AKA coefficient of determination.
*** $R^2$
$$
R^2 = 1-\frac{\sum_i (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_i(y_i - \bar{y})^2}
$$
i.e. 1-MSE/Variance

Negative $R^2$ values means they perform worse than a simple average of raw data.
As noise increases, $R^2$ decreases.
* Ensemble methods
** Introduction to ensemble methods
- Algorithms used in Big Data, e.g. SGD
- Ensemble methods
- Bias, variance, tradeoff
- Bagging
- Boosting
** Gradient descent for classification
- Basic optimization method
- Procedure for gradient descent
  1. Training dataset $D$ has $n$ pairs of $(x,y)$ data points
  2. Outputs are some parameters
  3. Find joint probability / likelihood $P(D|\theta)$
  4. Find gradient g = $dp(D|\theta)\over d\theta$
  5. Update gradient

Notes:
- Other methods can be used as long as gradient can be calculated.
- These can even be put in as "black box" inputs (by just plugging in the gradient computation as the function)
