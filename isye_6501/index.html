<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
In this text, Joel Sokol, Director of the Master of Science and Analytics degree at Georgia Tech, explains three non-parametric statistical tests: McNamara's Test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and Mann-Whitney test.
</p>

<p>
These tests are not advanced analytics methods, but they are not usually covered in basic statistics prerequisites.
</p>

<p>
McNamara's test is used to compare two competing treatments when they are tested on different patients, and there is no underlying distribution.
</p>

<p>
Wilcoxon signed rank test is used when we have no assumptions about what the response function is mathematically, and we only assume that it is continuous and symmetric. The test answers whether the median of the distribution is different from a specific value M.
</p>

<p>
Mann-Whitney test is used to compare two samples where the outcomes are not paired, and we assume that all the observations are independent of each other.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
This lesson discusses how to choose the appropriate statistical test for different types of situations.
</p>

<p>
The different types of tests include parametric tests, non-parametric tests related to the median, and a specific type of non-parametric test that tracks successes and failures.
</p>

<p>
The lesson also covers two aspects of choosing the right statistical test: determining whether to use a one or two sample test, and deciding which type of test to use depending on the type of data involved.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the lesson provides an example to illustrate how to choose the appropriate test in a given situation.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Which type of test would you use if you are analyzing the mean of a single data set?
A. One sample parametric test
B. Two sample parametric test
C. One sample non-parametric test
D. Paired binomial-based test</li>

<li>When comparing two data sets, which test would you use if the data sets are not inherently paired?

<p>
The passage introduces Bayesian models and their usage in analytics. It explains the basics of Bayes rule, which is a rule of conditional probability, and provides an example of using Bayes theorem to calculate the probability of having a disease given a positive test. The passage also describes empirical Bayes modeling, which is commonly used when there is little data available for a specific case. An example of using empirical Bayes modeling to estimate the strength difference between two basketball teams is provided, which shows how the model can make a prediction based on a single observation and a broader set of relevant observations. The passage emphasizes that understanding the intuition behind Bayesian models is crucial in explaining them to decision-makers who may not have a mathematical background.

<h3 id="org7b5e8b3"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> M16L03: Communities in graphs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
The lesson introduces a model called the Louvain algorithm for finding highly interconnected subpopulations in large interconnected populations, such as social media networks, disease outbreaks, computer viruses, language spread, and terrorist networks.
</p>

<p>
The lesson explains the standard terminology used in graph theory, including nodes, edges, cliques, and communities. The Louvain algorithm maximizes the modularity of a graph, a measure of how well the graph is separated into communities that are highly connected internally but not much between each other.
</p>

<p>
The algorithm has a few mostly repeated steps, including creating super-nodes and super-arcs between communities. Although the Louvain algorithm is a heuristic and not guaranteed to find the best partition of a graph, it often provides good solutions quickly and is useful for finding communities in large networks.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What is the Louvain algorithm used for?
A. Solving mathematically hard problems
B. Finding highly interconnected subpopulations in large interconnected populations
C. Separating a graph into communities that are highly connected between each other
D. Maximizing the weight of arcs in a graph</li>

<li>What is a clique in graph theory?
A. A small group of people who stick together and exclude others
B. A set of nodes that all have edges between each other
C. The total weight of all the arcs connected to a node

<h3 id="org82f67d5"><span class="section-number-3">1.5.</span> M16L04: Neural networks and deep learning</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
The lesson introduces two analytics models: neural networks and deep learning, which are often used for recognizing patterns that are difficult to specify using rules or algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Neural networks are modeled after the way neurons work in the brain, with input neurons, hidden neurons, and output neurons. The weights of the inputs are adjusted based on how wrong the outputs are, using algorithms like gradient descent.
</p>

<p>
Training neural networks is difficult, as they require a lot of training data, and it's hard to choose and tune the learning algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Deep learning is a similar approach to neural networks but with more layers, which has had success in natural language processing, speech recognition, and image recognition.
</p>

<p>
Although deep learning is a hot research topic, it's often used for processing text and language, and it's covered in an elective course.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Why are neural networks and deep learning used?
A. To specify patterns using rules or algorithms
B. To react to patterns that we don't understand
C. To separate input and output neurons
D. To adjust the weights of the inputs based on the output</li>

<li>What is the input level in an artificial neural network?
A. The output level on one side
B. The hidden level in the middle
C. The level where external inputs come into each input neuron
D. The level where simulated neurons calculate a weighted value of the inputs</li>

<li>What is the difference between neural networks and deep learning?
A. Neural networks have more layers than deep learning
B. Deep learning is a better approach than neural networks
C. Neural networks are used for speech recognition and image recognition, while deep learning is used for natural language processing

<p>
In this lesson, the concept of competitive decision-making using game theory is introduced. Game theory is used in situations where the outcome of a decision depends on the decisions of others.
</p>

<p>
The lesson explains the basics of game theory using the example of two gas stations competing for customers. The gas stations can set their prices to $2.50 or $2. If they both set the same price, they will split the demand half and half.
</p>

<p>
In this lesson, Joel Sokol explains how natural language processing (NLP) is a type of data that requires different modeling techniques.
</p>

<p>
NLP models can help machines to recognize and understand human language, which can be useful in various fields such as healthcare, technical support, and legal document searching.
</p>

<p>
NLP includes several tasks such as speech to text, identifying the speaker's words and meaning, co-reference, grammatical tagging, sentiment analysis, and message construction.
</p>

<p>
While NLP is an important and growing application of analytics and data science, it can still be challenging due to the complexities of language, including idioms, metaphors, and multiple word definitions. The lesson concludes with a humorous anecdote about a call center operator with a voice that sounded like a machine, demonstrating that even humans can struggle with language understanding.
